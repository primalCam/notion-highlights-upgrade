# Readwise vs Notion Highlights 2025 – The Ultimate Highlight Battle 📚

Readwise = the king of book/PDF/Kindle highlights.  
Notion Highlights = the king of web/article/thread highlights.

We synced 5,000+ highlights from both tools. Here’s exactly when to use which — and when to stack them.

## Feature Showdown

| Feature                        | Notion Highlights                         | Readwise                                 | Winner          |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Web/Article Highlighting       | Native right-click                        | Only via browser extension               | Notion          |
| Kindle/PDF/Books               | Via export only                           | Best-in-class sync                       | Readwise        |
| Sync Speed                     | Instant                                   | 5–30 min delay                           | Notion          |
| Notion Integration             | Native – lands as database rows           | Via official integration (solid)         | Tie             |
| Spaced Repetition              | Not yet                                   | World-class                              | Readwise        |
| Highlight Organization         | Databases, relations, AI                  | Tags + search                            | Notion          |
| Pricing                        | $299 lifetime                             | $8/mo                                    | Notion          |

## The Perfect Stack (What winners use)

1. Readwise → captures Kindle, PDFs, Twitter, books  
2. Readwise official integration → sends everything to Notion  
3. Notion Highlights → captures everything web-based that Readwise misses (Reddit, YouTube, live sites)

Result: One single Notion database with every highlight you’ve ever made anywhere.

## Verdict

- If you read 5+ books/month → keep Readwise  
- If you live on the web → Notion Highlights replaces 90 % of Readwise  
- If you want both → stack them (costs $299 one-time + $96/year)
