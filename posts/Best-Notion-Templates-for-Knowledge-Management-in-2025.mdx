## How to Choose the Right Template

Consider:
1. **Your workflow** - Research vs creation vs learning
2. **Complexity tolerance** - Simple vs comprehensive
3. **Customization needs** - Rigid vs flexible
4. **Team vs personal** - Collaboration requirements

## Customization Guide

Every template needs tweaking. Here's how:

### Phase 1: Import and Test
- Use template as-is for 1 week
- Note friction points
- Identify unused features

### Phase 2: Simplify
- Remove unnecessary databases
- Consolidate similar views
- Streamline properties

### Phase 3: Enhance
- Add your specific workflows
- Create custom automations
- Build unique views

## Integration with Web Clipping

Templates shine when combined with web clipping:

**Research Template:**
- Clip papers directly to database
- Auto-populate citation fields
- Link highlights to projects

**Learning Template:**
- Save tutorial highlights
- Build resource library
- Track learning progress

**Content Template:**
- Clip inspiration

## Common Template Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Over-complication**
Don't use all properties. Start minimal, add as needed.

**Mistake 2: Template hoarding**
Pick ONE system, commit for 30 days before switching.

**Mistake 3: No adaptation**
Templates are starting points, not final solutions.

## Building Custom Templates

Once familiar with pre-made templates:

1. **Identify repeated workflows**
2. **Document the process**
3. **Create reusable structure**
4. **Test and refine**
5. **Share with community**
