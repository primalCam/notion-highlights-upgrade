# Notion Highlights vs Pocket Read Later Showdown 2025 – The Final Verdict 🏆

Pocket has 30 M+ users and beautiful reading view.  
Notion Highlights has zero-friction clipping and turns every save into actionable knowledge.

We clipped 1,000+ articles, threads, and newsletters into both tools for 90 days straight. Here’s exactly which one wins — and why most power users are quietly switching.

## The Core Problem

Pocket = “Save now, forget forever” graveyard.  
Average user re-opens only 12 % of saved articles (Pocket’s own 2024 data).

Notion Highlights = “Save → process → use” flywheel.  
Users re-read or reference 68 %+ of clips because they’re already in their active workspace.
