# 👤 Step 1: Create Your Contacts Database

Your CRM starts with a clean contacts list.

Include fields like:

- Name  
- Status (Lead, Active Client, Past Client, Cold Lead, Partner)  
- Priority  
- Last Contacted  
- Next Follow-Up  
- Email  
- Phone  
- Company  
- Notes  

Keep it minimal — only track what you’ll actually use.

---

# 🔁 Step 2: Build the Follow-Up System

Follow-ups are the heart of every CRM.  
Most people lose opportunities simply because they forget to check in.

Your follow-up system should include:

- **Last Contacted** date  
- **Next Follow-Up** date  
- **Follow-Up Frequency** (7 days, 14 days, 30 days)  
- **Automated filtered view:** “Follow Up Today”  

This gives you a daily list of relationships to nurture.

---

# 📞 Step 3: Add a Sales Pipeline

If you handle deals, consultations, or client work, you’ll want a simple pipeline:

- Lead  
- Qualified  
- In Conversation  
- Proposal Sent  
- Negotiating  
- Closed Won  
- Closed Lost  

Each pipeline item links back to a contact.

You can add fields like:

- Deal value  
- Close probability  
- Notes  
- Meeting logs  
- Files or documents  

A clear pipeline prevents deals from slipping through the cracks.

---

# 📝 Step 4: Add Call Notes & Meeting Logs

Every outreach, call, meeting, or update should have a record.

Create a linked "Notes" database with:

- Date  
- Summary  
- Action items  
- Related contact  
- Next steps  

This builds your relationship history over time.

---

# 📅 Step 5: Build a Calendar View for Follow-Ups

A calendar view makes it easy to visualize outreach.

Filter by:

- Next Follow-Up  
- Status  
- Priority  

This lets you plan your outreach cadence at a glance.

---

# 🧩 Step 6: Add Your Tasks & Action Items

Your CRM should connect to your task manager.

Tasks can include:

- Sending proposals  
- Following up  
- Preparing onboarding  
- Delivering work  
- Scheduling calls  

Link each task to its related contact so your entire workflow stays connected.

---

# 📊 Step 7: Add a Dashboard to Control Everything

Your main CRM dashboard includes:

- “Follow Up Today”  
- “New Leads”  
- “Active Deals”  
- “Contacts Needing Attention”  
- “Upcoming Meetings”  
- “Important Clients”  
- “Recent Notes”  

This becomes your daily command center.

# 🚀 Who This CRM Is Perfect For

A Notion CRM works especially well for:

- Freelancers  
- Solo consultants  
- Coaches  
- Agencies  
- Service providers  
- Startup founders  
- Content creators  
- Anyone managing relationships  

It gives you the structure of a CRM without the weight.
