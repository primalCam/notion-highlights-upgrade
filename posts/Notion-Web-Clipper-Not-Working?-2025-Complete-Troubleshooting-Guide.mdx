- Banking sites

**Workarounds:**
1. Copy content manually to temporary tab
2. Save from the copied content
3. Or screenshot → OCR → save text

**Note:** This is a security feature, not a bug. Can't be "fixed."

### "No pages available"

**What it means:** Extension can't see your Notion workspace.

**Fix (2 minutes):**
1. Click extension icon
2. Check workspace selector
3. If wrong workspace showing:
   - Disconnect account
   - Reconnect and authorize correct workspace
4. If no workspaces showing:

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Mac-Specific Problems

**Issue:** Extension works on some sites but not others (M1/M2 Macs)

**Fix:**
- Update Chrome to latest version (Rosetta compatibility)
- Or use Chrome Canary (native ARM build)

**Issue:** Keyboard shortcut conflicts with system shortcuts

**Fix:**
- Chrome Extensions → Keyboard shortcuts
- Change from Cmd+Shift+S to something else
- Avoid Cmd+Option+[letter] (usually taken by macOS)

### Windows-Specific Problems

**Issue:** Extension not appearing after installation

**Fix:**
- Check Windows Defender didn't block it
- Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Allow app
- Or temporarily disable during installation

**Issue:** High memory usage causing crashes

**Fix:**
- Task Manager → Check Chrome's memory
- Close unused tabs/extensions
- Increase virtual memory if < 8GB RAM

### Linux-Specific Problems

**Issue:** Extension not installing on Linux builds

**Fix:**
- Use Google Chrome (not Chromium)
- Or verify extension sync is enabled
- Check ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/

**Issue:** Permission errors on save

**Fix:**
- Check file system permissions
- Run: `chmod -R 755 ~/.config/google-chrome/`

## Browser-Specific Fixes

### Chrome/Chromium Issues

**Conflicting extensions:**

Common conflicts:
- Other Notion clippers (disable duplicates)
- Ad blockers blocking API calls (whitelist notion.so)
- Privacy extensions blocking scripts (add exception)

**Fix:**
1. Disable all other extensions temporarily
2. Test if saving works
3. Re-enable extensions one-by-one to identify conflict

### Brave Browser Issues

**Issue:** Shields blocking extension functionality

**Fix:**
1. Click Brave Shields icon
2. For notion.so: set Shields DOWN
3. For extension permissions: Allow all

**Issue:** Fingerprint blocking

**Fix:**
- Settings → Shields → Advanced
- Change fingerprint blocking to "Standard"

### Edge Browser Issues

**Issue:** Extension from Chrome Web Store not working

**Fix:**
- Install from official Edge Add-ons store instead
- Or enable "Allow extensions from other stores"

**Issue:** Sync issues between devices

**Fix:**
- Edge Settings → Profiles → Sync → Extensions (enable)
- Or set up Edge account if not using one

## Network & Firewall Issues

### Corporate Network Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Works at home but not at office
- Intermittent connection failures
- "Network error" messages

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if notion.so is accessible
2. Test on mobile hotspot (bypasses corporate firewall)
3. If works on hotspot → firewall issue

**Solutions:**
1. **For IT admins:** Whitelist these domains:
   - *.notion.so
   - api.notion.com
   - *.notion-static.com

2. **For users:** Contact IT with this request
3. **Workaround:** Use mobile app or personal device for clipping

### VPN-Related Issues

**Issue:** Extension stops working when VPN connected

**Fix:**
1. Whitelist Notion domains in VPN split tunneling
2. Or disconnect VPN temporarily for saving
3. Or use VPN with better compatibility

**Issue:** Slow saves or timeouts

**Fix:**
- Switch VPN server (choose geographically closer)
- Use WireGuard protocol instead of OpenVPN
- Upgrade VPN plan for better speeds

## Permission Issues

### Extension Not Accessing Pages

**Issue:** "Click to enable on this site"

**What it means:** Extensions defaulted to click-to-run mode.

**Fix (permanent):**
1. Right-click extension icon
2. "This can read and change site data"
3. Select "On all sites" or "On [specific site]"

**Issue:** "Extension cannot access this page"

**What it means:** Chrome Web Store, settings, or restricted pages.

**Reality check:** Extensions can't work on:
- chrome:// URLs
- Chrome Web Store pages
- New Tab page
- Some Google services

**Workaround:** Copy content to temporary document, save from there.

### Notion OAuth Connection Issues

**Issue:** "Failed to authenticate"

**Fix:**
1. Clear cookies for notion.so specifically:
   - Settings → Privacy → Cookies and site data
   - See all site data → Search "notion"
   - Remove all
2. Log into Notion fresh
3. Reauthorize extension

**Issue:** "Token expired" or similar

**Fix:**
- Extension automatically refreshes tokens
- If failing: disconnect and reconnect account in extension settings

## Data & Sync Issues

### Saves Not Appearing in Notion

**Check these:**

1. **Right workspace?**
   - Check workspace selector in extension
   - You might have multiple Notion accounts

2. **Right page/database?**
   - Verify target page in extension settings
   - Search Notion for the save (might be in unexpected location)

3. **Sync delay?**
   - Wait 30 seconds, refresh Notion
   - Check "All Updates" in Notion sidebar

4. **Quota exceeded?**
   - Free tier: 30 saves/month
   - Check usage in extension popup
   - Upgrade or wait for next month

### Duplicate Saves

**Issue:** Same content saved multiple times

**Cause:** Clicking save button repeatedly during lag.

**Fix:**
- Wait for confirmation before clicking again
- Check "Saving..." indicator
- Use CMD+Z / CTRL+Z to undo duplicates in Notion

**Prevention:**
- Enable "Show save confirmation" in settings
- Practice patience during slow network conditions

### Lost Formatting

**Issue:** Saved content doesn't preserve formatting

**Common causes:**
1. **Website uses complex formatting:** Notion can't represent all HTML
2. **Code blocks not detected:** Manually format as code in Notion
3. **Tables broken:** Notion tables have limitations

**Workarounds:**
- For code: Select as code before saving
- For tables: Save as text, reformat in Notion
- For images: Save separately, insert manually

## Performance Issues

### Slow Saves

**Normal save time:** 1-3 seconds
**Slow save:** 5+ seconds

**Causes & fixes:**

**Large content (> 10,000 words):**
- Break into smaller chunks
- Save summary instead of full text

**Many images:**
- Images upload individually (adds time)
- Save text first, images later if needed

**Slow internet:**
- Check connection speed
- Use wired connection if possible
- Save drafts locally first

**Notion server load:**
- Check status.notion.so
- Try during off-peak hours (avoid Monday mornings US time)

### High Memory Usage

**Issue:** Chrome using excessive RAM after installing extension

**Diagnosis:**
- Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc)
- Find extension in list
- Check memory usage

**Acceptable:** < 100MB
**Excessive:** > 500MB

**Fixes:**
1. Restart browser (clears memory leaks)
2. Update extension (bug fixes)
3. Disable extension when not actively researching
4. Close unused tabs

### Extension Causing Browser Crashes

**Rare but happens:**

**Immediate fix:**
1. Boot into Safe Mode: Chrome → More tools → Extensions
2. Disable extension
3. Restart Chrome
4. Check if stable

**If stable without extension:**
1. Report bug to developer
2. Include Chrome version, OS, crash logs
3. Wait for update

**If still crashing:**
- Other extension or Chrome bug (not related)

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Developer Console Debugging

For power users:

1. Right-click extension icon → "Inspect popup"
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Common error patterns:
   - **CORS errors:** Server configuration issue
   - **Network errors:** Connection problem
   - **Permission errors:** Authorization issue

### Checking Extension Files

**For developers:**

1. Navigate to: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Find extension → Details → "View in folder"
4. Check manifest.json for correct permissions
5. Look for file corruption or missing files

### Testing API Connectivity

**Manual API test:**

1. Get Notion API token from extension settings
2. Use curl or Postman:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.notion.com/v1/pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
3. If this fails → API connectivity issue
4. If this works → extension bug

## When to Reinstall vs. When to Wait

### Reinstall if:
- Error messages mention corruption
- Extension icon is missing/broken
- Tried all basic fixes without success
- Last resort before contacting support

### Wait/Don't reinstall if:
- Notion server status shows issues
- Problem is intermittent (suggests external cause)
- Just updated extension (give it time to stabilize)
- Corporate network blocks extensions

## Prevention Best Practices

**Keep extension working smoothly:**

1. **Regular Chrome updates:** Weekly check
2. **Don't hoard tabs:** Close unused tabs (reduces conflicts)
3. **Stable internet:** Use wired when possible for critical work
4. **Backup important saves:** Critical content → copy to notes first
5. **Test after Chrome updates:** Try one save after each update
6. **Monitor usage:** Track saves-per-month (avoid quota surprises)

## Getting Help

### Before contacting support:

Document:
- Chrome version
- Extension version
- Operating system

## The Nuclear Option: Complete Reset

Last resort (10 minutes):

1. Export your Notion data (Notion Settings → Export)
2. Uninstall extension completely
3. Clear all Chrome data: Settings → Advanced → Reset
4. Restart computer (clears all caches)
5. Reinstall Chrome (if truly desperate)
6. Reinstall extension
7. Sign into Notion
8. Test

**Only do this if:**
- Everything else failed
- You've backed up data
- You have time for complete reconfiguration

## Success Metrics

**Your extension is healthy if:**
- 95%+ successful saves
- Save time < 3 seconds average
- No crashes in past week
- Memory usage < 150MB
- Can save from 90%+ of sites you visit

**Your extension needs attention if:**
- < 80% success rate
- Frequent error messages

- Missing from toolbar unpredictably

## Moving Forward

After fixing:

1. **Test thoroughly:** Try 10 saves from different sites
2. **Note the fix:** Document what worked (for next time)
3. **Monitor performance:** Watch for return of issues
4. **Update systems:** Keep browser and extensions current
5. **Have backup method:** Always have plan B for critical work
