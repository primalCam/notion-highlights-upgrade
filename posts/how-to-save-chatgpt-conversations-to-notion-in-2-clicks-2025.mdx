# How to Save ChatGPT Conversations to Notion in 2 Clicks With Highlights 2025

You just had a 45-minute ChatGPT session that gave you the perfect content calendar, product teardown, or research framework…  
…and now you’re about to lose it forever when you close the tab.

Here’s the dead-simple workflow that 50k+ power users rely on in 2025 to save every golden ChatGPT conversation to Notion — complete with your highlights, code blocks, and perfect formatting — in literally two clicks.

## Why Most People Lose Their Best ChatGPT Sessions

- The official “share link” dies or goes private  
- Copy-paste destroys code blocks and tables  
- Screenshots are impossible to search later  
- Built-in Notion web clipper strips highlights and formatting  
- You waste 10–15 minutes manually cleaning every thread

## The 2-Click Solution: Notion Highlights

**Step 1** → Install Notion Highlights (takes 11 seconds)

**Step 2** → Next time you’re in a ChatGPT conversation you love:
- Highlight the parts that matter (any color you want)  
- Click the Notion Highlights extension icon → “Save to Notion”  
- Choose your database/page → done.

That’s it. The entire thread appears in Notion in <4 seconds with:
- All your highlights preserved  
- Code blocks perfectly formatted  
- Full conversation history  
- Instant full-text search forever

## Pro Setup Most People Miss (Takes 60 Extra Seconds)

1. Create a “ChatGPT Vault” database in Notion with these properties:
   - Source → Fixed “ChatGPT”  
   - Date Saved → Created time  
   - Topic → Text  
   - Use Case → Select (Content/Marketing/Research/Code/etc)  
   - Highlights → Relation to your main highlights database

2. Set Notion Highlights to default to this database  
3. Turn on “Auto-tag with AI” → every thread gets 3–5 perfect tags automatically

Now every ChatGPT session becomes permanent, searchable, and reusable knowledge.

## Real-World Results from Users

## Bonus: Keyboard Shortcut (The Real 1-Click)

Zero clicks needed.
