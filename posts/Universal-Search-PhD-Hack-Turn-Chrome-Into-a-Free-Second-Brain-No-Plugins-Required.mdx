# Universal-Search PhD Hack: Turn Chrome Into a Free Second Brain (No Plugins Required) 🧠⚡

If your thesis tabs breed faster than you can read them, you need **Universal Search**, not another bookmark folder.  
Meet **Focus Dock**—a **Chrome productivity launcher** that turns **⌘+.** into a **lightning-fast command center** for every paper, note, and dataset you touch.

No sign-ups, no paid tiers, zero bloat.  
Below is the **4-minute workflow** PhD students use to **never lose a source again**.

---

## 1️⃣ Install & Summon Universal Search
- Add [Focus Dock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)  
- Hit `⌘+.` on **any** page—floating bar appears **instantly**  
- Type **fragments**, not exact titles—fuzzy search forgives typos

---

## 2️⃣ Capture Papers Faster Than Zotero
While browsing PubMed, arXiv, JSTOR:
- `/note ` + paste abstract → auto-saved **locally** with URL & timestamp  
- `/read ` + `Enter` → article parked in **distraction-free reading list**  
Both become **full-text searchable** the moment you hit `Enter`

---

## 3️⃣ Auto-Group 100+ Tabs by Domain
- Type `/autogroup` → Focus Dock **clusters every tab by domain**  
- PubMed, GitHub, Canvas, Notion—each family gets its **own label**  
No drag-and-drop; perfect for systematic-review chaos

---

## 4️⃣ Recall Anything in <1 Second
Forget folders. Just `⌘+.` and type **any** clue:
- “bayesian power” (words out of order)  
- “smith 23” (author + year)  
- “sample size too small” (your **personal note**)  
Results appear **before you finish typing**

---

## 5️⃣ Freeze & Resume Entire Work Sessions
End-of-day shutdown:
- `/save meta-analysis-v2`  
- Close Chrome **guilt-free**  
Next session: `/workspaces` → pick name—**every tab & note restored in 2 clicks**

---

## Bonus Commands You’ll Actually Use
- `/pubmed` – teleport to **all** open PubMed tabs  
- `/clip` – re-paste that DOI you copied **yesterday**  
- `/index` – refresh search cache after bulk imports  
- `/groups` – rename clusters on the fly  

---

## Privacy = Zero Compromise
- **100% local**: history, notes, clipboard **never** leave your device  
- **No accounts**: productive the second it installs  
- **No tracking**: your data = your thesis secrets  

---

## TL;DR
Focus Dock gives Chrome **Universal Search superpowers**:
- Find **any** paper, note, or history item in **<1 s**  
- Auto **tab manager** keeps 200+ sources sane  
- **Keyboard-first** = zero mouse friction  

Install free, tap `⌘+.`, and turn your browser into the **fastest free Second Brain** you’ll ever own.
