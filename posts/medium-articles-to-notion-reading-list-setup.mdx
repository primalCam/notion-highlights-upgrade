# Medium Articles to Notion Reading List Setup

Medium is one of the best places for long-form learning: deep dives, personal essays, startup breakdowns, self-improvement posts, design thinking, data science lessons, and more. But the platform has one big problem:

**You can’t build a real, organized library of what you read.**

Medium’s built-in “save” feature isn’t enough — no tags, no highlights, no personal notes, no long-term structure, and no connection to your actual knowledge base.

This guide shows you how to turn Medium into a **personal reading hub** using Notion Highlights.

You’ll learn how to:

- Save articles instantly  
- Build a reading database  
- Track progress  
- Extract insights  
- Connect ideas across topics  
- Use Notion AI to summarize and compress long reads  

---

## Quick Overview

**Time Required:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**What You'll Learn:** How to save Medium articles and highlights to Notion automatically.

---

## Why This Matters

Medium posts cover some of the highest-signal writing on:

- Productivity  
- Technology  
- AI  
- Design  
- Entrepreneurship  
- Learning  
- Personal development  
- Software engineering  
- Marketing  
- Psychology  

But Medium content gets buried quickly.

### Problems with Medium’s native “save” system:

❌ No tags  
❌ No organization  
❌ No highlight system  
❌ No ability to add your own notes  
❌ No AI summaries  
❌ No project linking  
❌ No reading workflow  
❌ Hard to retrieve anything later  

If you’re a serious learner, student, founder, or researcher, you need a **real system** — not a bookmark pile.

Notion solves all of this.

# Step-by-Step Guide

## Step 1: Open Any Medium Article

This workflow works on:

- Medium posts  
- Medium publications  
- Stories  
- Tutorials  
- Long-form guides  
- Book summaries  
- Data science writeups  
- Founder essays  
- Productivity systems  
- Case studies  

If there’s text, you can capture it.

---

## Step 2: Highlight Any Section You Want to Save

Select the text that matters:

- Key quotes  
- Actionable steps  
- Research notes  
- Statistics  
- Definitions  
- Frameworks  
- Examples  
- Stories  
- Visual descriptions  
- Explanations  

This is far better than bookmarking the entire article — you capture only **signal**, not noise.

---

## Step 3: Right-Click → “Save to Notion”

This instantly saves:

- Highlighted text  
- Formatting  
- Article structure  
- Source URL  
- Context  
- Timestamps (if applicable)  
- Your own notes (optional)  

No switching tabs.  
No copy/paste.  
No workflow interruption.

---

## Step 4: Choose Destination in Notion

Most people create a database called:

### **📚 Medium Reading Library**

Properties you can add:

- Title  
- Author  
- Source  
- Topic  
- Tags  
- Key Takeaways  
- Status (Unread / Reading / Finished)  
- Rating  
- Length  
- Saved Date  
- Project link  
- AI summary  

Saving directly into a structured database turns random reading into **compounding knowledge**.

---

## Step 5: Verify Your Save

Inside Notion:

- Make sure formatting preserved  
- Add your notes  
- Update tags  
- Set reading status  
- Connect to related ideas  

Now the article becomes part of your long-term learning system — not lost in a feed.

# Pro Tips for Medium Power Readers

## **Tip 1 — Save Highlights, Not Whole Articles**

Most Medium posts are 70% fluff, 30% gold.

Capture the gold.

Your future self will thank you.

---

## **Tip 2 — Tag by Concept, Not Category**

Don’t tag by vague categories like:

- “Productivity”  
- “AI”  
- “Business”  

Tag by **actual ideas**, like:

- “Mental Models”  
- “Prompt Engineering”  
- “Founders’ Biases”  
- “Decision-Making”  
- “Learning Systems”  
- “UX Patterns”  

This builds a real knowledge graph.

---

## **Tip 3 — Use Notion AI to Summarize Long Articles**

Prompt example:

> “Summarize this Medium article into a 5-point actionable checklist.”

Or:

> “Rewrite this article using first principles. Strip out fluff.”

Or:

> “Extract only the frameworks and mental models from this article.”

This turns long reads into **executive summaries**.

---

## **Tip 4 — Build a Reading Sprint Each Week**

Every Sunday:

- Pick 3–5 articles  
- Save highlights  
- Add your notes  
- Link related insights  
- Turn takeaways into actions  

This transforms reading into output.

---

# Common Issues

### **Issue: Formatting looks strange**
Medium uses complex typography. Select a slightly larger section.

### **Issue: Missing parts of the article**
Some sections load dynamically — scroll fully before capturing.

### **Issue: Can’t find saved notes**
Search the source URL or check your default save location.

---
