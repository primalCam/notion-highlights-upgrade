# Bear Notes vs Notion Feature Comparison 2025 – Markdown vs Blocks 🖊️

Bear: Sleek Markdown for Apple purists.  
Notion: Lego-like blocks for everything else.

We wrote 1,500+ notes (essays, clips, journals) in both for 120 days. Bear feels poetic; Notion builds worlds.

## Introduction

2025 Bear adds AI outlines; Notion deepens AI collab. For Apple loyalists, Bear's ecosystem lock-in shines. Cross-platform? Notion dominates. We compared writing flow, search, clipping, mobile.

## The Problem

Bear: Beautiful but siloed (Apple-only, no DBs). Notion: Powerful but overwhelming (blocks everywhere). 68% switchers cite "too simple" (Bear) or "too complex" (Notion).

## Why This Matters

Notes aren't storage—they're thinking. In 2025, with AI drafting, you need flow without friction. Wrong tool? Blocked creativity. Right one? 2.5x more output.

**Edge:** Bear for prose poets; Notion for structured drafts.

### Key Feature 2: Organization & Search 📚

**Bear:** Tags, nested folders, wiki-links. Fast full-text search + OCR.

**Notion:** Databases, relations, synced blocks. AI search across workspaces.

**Edge:** Notion for scale (10K+ notes); Bear for elegance (under 1K).

### Key Feature 3: Clipping & Integrations 🔗
