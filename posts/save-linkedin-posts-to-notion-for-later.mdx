# Save LinkedIn Posts to Notion for Later

LinkedIn is one of the best platforms for **career growth, business insights, leadership lessons, and industry knowledge** — but the content disappears fast. Your feed refreshes, posts get buried, creators delete old content, and saving posts inside LinkedIn isn’t enough.

This guide shows you how to capture **any LinkedIn post, article, comment thread, or career insight** and organize it cleanly inside Notion.

If you’re building a professional knowledge base, preparing for job interviews, growing your business, or tracking industry trends — this workflow gives you a superpower.

---

## Quick Overview

**Time Required:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**What You'll Learn:** How to save LinkedIn posts, insights, and discussions into Notion instantly.

---

## Why This Matters

LinkedIn is full of high-value content:

- Breaking industry news  
- Deep leadership insights  
- Real-world career lessons  
- Startup and SaaS breakdowns  
- Hiring manager advice  
- Growth strategy threads  
- Founder frameworks  
- Personal branding tips  
- Networking wisdom  
- Case studies and data  

But the platform is *designed* for consumption, not for long-term knowledge retention.

### The problem with saving posts inside LinkedIn:

❌ Posts get buried  
❌ Saved items have no tags or structure  
❌ You can’t connect ideas to projects  
❌ You can’t build a real knowledge system  
❌ You lose track of what you saved  
❌ No space to add your own notes  
❌ No AI assistance for organizing  

Notion solves all of that.

Using Notion Highlights as the capture tool + Notion as the knowledge hub gives you the workflow LinkedIn should’ve built.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome browser  
- Notion Highlights installed  
- Notion account (free plan is fine)

After saving, add a section like:

**“My Notes:”**

- Why this matters  
- How you’ll apply it

## **Tip 3 — Link to Projects or Goals**

Link saved posts to:

- Job search materials

> “Turn this post into a weekly execution plan.”

This upgrades every LinkedIn post from “doom-scroll content” → “career leverage.”
