# How to Save Twitter Threads to Notion Perfectly Every Time 2025

You just found a 42-tweet thread that perfectly explains your next product launch, content strategy, or life philosophy…  
…and the second you close the tab, it’s gone forever (or buried behind “For You” chaos).

Here’s the dead-simple, 100% reliable method that 60k+ creators, founders, and marketers use in 2025 to save every golden Twitter/X thread to Notion — complete with images, videos, replies, and your highlights — in under 5 seconds flat.

## Why Every Other Method Still Sucks in 2025

- Official Notion clipper → breaks after tweet 12, loses videos  
- Screenshot threads → impossible to search, looks amateur  
- Copy-paste → destroys formatting and images  
- Third-party “thread readers” → die in 60 days  
- Bookmarking → you’ll never find it again

## The Perfect Solution: Notion Highlights

One extension. One click. Everything saved perfectly.

**Step-by-step (takes 9 seconds first time):**

1. Install Notion Highlights  
   → https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notion-highlights/addpdkeebbfpcgificcaojjkbpddjhka?authuser=1&hl=en&pli=1

2. Open any Twitter/X thread you love

3. Highlight the parts that slap (optional but recommended)

4. Click the Notion Highlights icon → “Save Thread to Notion”

5. Pick your database/page → done

Result: The entire thread appears in Notion in <5 seconds with:
- Every tweet in perfect order  
- All images and videos embedded  
- Your highlights preserved in full color  
- Replies and quote tweets included  
- Full-text searchable forever

## Real Examples from Power Users

- Founder saved 127 threads → turned 7 into a $1.2M launch sequence  
- Content team at 8-figure brand has 1,400+ saved threads → never runs out of hooks  
- Writer built a “Twitter Gold” database with 3,200 saved threads → writes 4x faster

## Pro Setup (60-Second Power Move)

Create a dedicated “Twitter Vault” database with these properties:
- Author → Text  
- Date Saved → Created time  
- Hook Type → Select (Story/Proof/Contrarian/Tactic/etc)  
- Performance → Number (likes + replies)  
- Used In Content → Relation

Set Notion Highlights to default here → every thread becomes instantly organized and reusable.

## Bonus Features You’ll Use Every Day

- Right-click any tweet → “Save single tweet to Notion”  
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S) → save without leaving keyboard  
- AI auto-tags every thread in Pro
