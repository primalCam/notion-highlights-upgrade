### Real Talk: Scaling Your Capture Game
Ever hit that wall where inspo overload kills output? Here's the hack: Use Notion's formula props in your DB to score clips – e.g., "Virality Score = if(Engage > 50k, 'Hot', 'Warm')". Pair with Highlights' auto-tags for instant sorting. One creator I chatted with (anon shoutout) went from 5 posts/week to 15, crediting this setup. Test it: Clip 10 trends today, tag 'em, and watch your calendar fill like magic. No more "blank reel" blues!

### Bonus: Multi-Platform Mastery
TikTok for quick hits? IG for stories? YT for deeps? Highlights bridges 'em – OAuth toggles per clip type. Example: Grab a TikTok sound bite (text + embed), tag "Audio Hack," then remix in IG Reels via Notion's gallery view. Pro move: Export DB to CSV for tools like Buffer – seamless scheduling without copy-paste purgatory.

## 🏁 Creator Charged: Your Content Connects 🧠

Charged up – content creator crown! Clips + embeds = viral vectors. Right-click one reel riff today – trends transform. 🌟
