### Real Talk: Snippet Scaling Secrets
Tab-hoarding killing your keystrokes? Supercharge with Highlights' fences: Clip a Python puzzle from LeetCode, auto-tag "Algo," then rollup your DB by lang usage. A dev duo I looped in (anon fist-bump) halved debug time, merging 50% more PRs/month. Lua love: Think of it like your Roblox scripts – clip once, reuse forever. Trial run: Snag 10 snippets today, fence 'em, formula-filter – watch your backlog vanish!

### Bonus: Multi-Lang Mastery
JS for front? Python for back? Rust for rocket? Highlights handles – lang-select auto-highlights syntax. Example: Grab a Node.js nod (code + embed), tag "API," then port to Py via linked toggles. Pro push: Integrate GitHub Actions for auto-commits from starred snippets – deploy dreams without diff dread.

## 🏁 Dev Dominated: Your Code Conquers 🧠

Dominated – dev dynasty! Clips + embeds = conquest codes. Right-click one regex today – builds blast. 🌟
