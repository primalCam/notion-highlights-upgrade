# Save Wikipedia Articles to Notion 2025 – The Ultimate Research Upgrade 🧠

Wikipedia is the deepest free knowledge base ever created – but it’s designed for browsing, not owning.

Here’s how to turn any Wikipedia page (or just the sections you care about) into perfectly formatted, fully cited, searchable Notion notes in under 5 seconds – with tables, images references, and internal wiki links preserved.

## Quick Overview

**Time Required:** 4 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Saves per session:** Most researchers do 15–40 Wikipedia clips per project

## Why Every Serious Researcher Needs This Workflow in 2025

- Wikipedia has 6.7 million+ English articles and growing  
- The average knowledge worker spends 2.5 hours/week on research  
- 87 % of students admit to losing track of sources (2024 survey)  
- Proper citation management saves ~6 hours per research paper

Stop copy-pasting. Start owning knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome / Edge / Brave  
- Notion Highlights installed (free)
